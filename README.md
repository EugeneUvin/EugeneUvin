* [CSVPad](https://github.com/EugeneUvin/CSVPad) is an old CSV editing progam written in Delphi. It is very lightweight and can be handy if you need to work with CSV. However,  I've found few [bugs](https://github.com/EugeneUvin/CSVPad/issues). If you feel like remembering Paskal, feel free to PR :-)
